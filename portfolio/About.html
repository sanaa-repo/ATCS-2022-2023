        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Sanaa Kapur and I am an 11th grade student and aspiring computer scientist.
            I first started coding when I was 10 as part of a First Lego League robotics team. 
            I loved the thrill of creating something new and wanted to learned more.
            Since then, I have explored several programming languages like Java, HTML/CSS,
            EV3, C++ and Python. I especially enjoy programming robots as it helps me see the 
            applications of CS to the world at large.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am not coding, I enjoy practicing Kung Fu, reading, and spending time with my 
            younger brother.
        </p>
