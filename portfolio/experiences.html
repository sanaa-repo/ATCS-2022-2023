            <b>Robot Odometry</b>

            <br>

            Used data from wheels and some discrete aproximations to create a virtual coordinate system. 
            <br>
            This allows for the robot to traverse an area precisely and without dependancy on any sensors.
            <br>

            Skills include: Java, OpenCV

            <b>Spiking Neural Network Image Processing</b>

            <br>

            Worked with spiking neural networks, a time-based ANN that can process data in real time, 
            <br>
            to create architecture that recognizes numbers from the N-MINST dataset. 
            <br>

            Skills include: Python, snnTorch

            <b>Checkers using Minimax</b>

            <br>

            Implemented the Minimax algorithm on a checkers game   
            <br>
            This allows for the robot to traverse an area precisely and without dependancy on any sensors.
            <br>

            Skills include: Java, Graphics

            <br>

            Used Java to create a hangman game.
            <br>

            Skills include: Java, Graphics

            <b>Robot Heading Follower</b>

            <br>

            Used data from gyroscope to create a heading follower(a kinematics optimization program).
            <br>

            Skills include: Java, Android Studio
