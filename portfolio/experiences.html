            <b>Robot Odometry</b>

            <br>

            Used data from wheels and some discrete aproximations to create a virtual coordinate system. 
            <br>
            This allows for the robot to traverse an area precisely and without dependancy on any sensors.
            <br>

            Skills include: Java, OpenCV
